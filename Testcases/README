Commands for the testcases

Note: When there are brackets [] around a name, that is something you insert accordingly.

Note: I don't think you need to make individual test.xml files, but I included them in case you wanted to test specific numbers

Test 1
Run bambu with the C code, test file, and constraints. Make sure to enable print-dot.
python assetflow.py [HLS_datapath.dot] [OP_variables.dot] top b m false
python parser.py top.c b

Run bambu on top1 with test file and constraints.
Run bambu with the C code, test file, constraints, and module_lib. Make sure to enable print dot (I have written out this command to you before).
If you get an error, it doesn't matter as long as you get top.v as a result.
python assetflow.py [new HLS_datapath.dot] [OP_variables.dot] top b m auto (you may have to switch the "b" out for "a" to see the blue path)


Test2
Run bambu (constraints)
python assetflow.py [HLS_datapath.dot] [OP_variables.dot] top b m false
python parser.py top.c b

Run bambu on top1
Run bambu (constraints and module_lib)
python assetflow.py [new HLS_datapath.dot] [OP_variables.dot] top b m auto


Test3
Run bambu
python assetflow.py [HLS_datapath.dot] [OP_variables.dot] top c b false
python parser.py top.c c

Run bambu (constraints and module_lib)
python assetflow.py [new HLS_datapath.dot] [OP_variables.dot] top c b auto
